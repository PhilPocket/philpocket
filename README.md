**Why** I use:

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

1.  **Hardware & Software Synergy**

    I value a unified system that integrates hardware and software in tandem.
    It lets me focus on productivity from day one rather than wasting time
    troubleshooting hardware issues. Hence my avoidance of fragmented systems
    like [Linux distributions].

2.  **Unix Foundation**

    I value a Unix-based system that provides native terminal access to OS
    primitives. It lets me use familiar server workflows locally rather than
    managing virtualization layers. Hence my avoidance of non-Unix systems like
    [Windows].
